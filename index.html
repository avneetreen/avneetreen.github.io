    Hi, I'm Avneet. Based in Copenhagen, I work as a data engineer at Novo Nordisk. I'm curious about and interested in building tech that adds value to society. 
    I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, with a focus on data sciences and machine learning. 
    Some of my projects are highlighted below! If you're interested in collaborating, give a shout!
